# XR-HPGT: Spatiotemporal Calibration and Ground Truth Estimation for High-Precision SLAM Benchmarking in Extended Reality

ðŸš§ **Coming Soon** â€” Weâ€™re preparing for the open-source release of **XR-HPGT**.

**XR-HPGT** is an estimator designed for **H**igh-**P**recision spatiotemporal calibration and **G**round **T**ruth estimation to support benchmarking of visual-inertial SLAM (VI-SLAM) systems, with a particular focus on applications in the field of Extended Reality (**XR**).
